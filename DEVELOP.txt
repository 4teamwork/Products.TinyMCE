Releasing TinyMCE
=================

Getting a new upstream version
-------------------------------

Let's say current version in Products.TinyMCE is 3.4.3 and upstream is 3.4.7

$ cd src/tinymce
$ git checkout 3.4.3
$ git checkout -b 3.4.7
$ git rebase --ignore-whitespace --onto 3.4.7-plone 3.4.3 3.4.7

Ignore whitespace makes sure different lineendings are not an issue while merging.

PS: It is highly recommended to use meld for merging:

$ git config --global merge.tool meld


Known local fixes which need to be merged
-----------------------------------------

- fixes in skins/tinymce/tiny_mce_src.js
- fixes in skins/tinymce/plugins/paste/pastetext.html.pt and
  skins/tinymce/plugins/paste/js/pastetext.js
- others?

Prerequisites
+++++++++++++

If you are on a Mac, install `apache-ant` from macports. Otherwise:

- Install the Java JDK or JRE packages
- Install Apache Ant
- Add Apache Ant to your systems path environment variable. This is not
  required but makes it easier to issue commands to Ant without having to type
  the full path for it.
